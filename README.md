# XzDart - A practice console application in Dart

## About the project

XzDart is a console application that takes commands and parameters to display the solution to algorithmic problems presented at [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/dart/exercises).

The purpose of this project is to practice the implementation of the `args` and `test` packages while also solving **programming exercises** in Dart.

Further documentation will be provided as the project progresses.
