Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For the purposes of this exercise you can expect that a word will always be one of:

A number composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
A simple word composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
A contraction of two simple words joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")
When counting words you can assume the following rules:

The count is case insensitive (ie "You", "you", and "YOU" are 3 uses of the same word)
The count is unordered; the tests will ignore how words and counts are ordered
Other than the apostrophe in a contraction all forms of punctuation are ignored
The words can be separated by any form of whitespace (ie "\t", "\n", " ")
